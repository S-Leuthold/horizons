## Specific Technical Findings

### Critical Issues to Address

1. **SHAP Feature Selection Bug** (`step-feature_selection_shap.R:136-152`)
   ```r
   # Current implementation uses XGBoost importance
   importance_scores <- xgboost::xgb.importance(model = xgb_model)
   # Should use true SHAP values instead
   ```

2. **Validation Robustness** 
   - 5% holdout set too small for reliable evaluation
   - 3-fold CV insufficient; recommend 5-10 folds
   - Geographic data needs spatial validation strategies

3. **Function Complexity**
   - `covariates-soil-orchestrator.R`: 528+ lines
   - `evaluation-run_model_batches.R`: 400+ lines
   - Recommend decomposition into smaller, focused functions

### Minor Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Spectral Preprocessing Expansion**
   - Add standalone MSC option
   - Include detrending and baseline correction
   - Implement OSC or EPO scatter correction

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add formal benchmarking capabilities
   - Implement more aggressive caching strategies
   - Consider computational profiling

3. **Testing Enhancements**
   - Add code coverage reporting
   - Include performance/benchmark tests
   - Expand edge case coverage
