Description: Provides functions to construct, tune, and evaluate spectral ensemble models 
    for soil property prediction using mid-infrared (MIR) data. Includes a modular system 
    for generating model grids, applying spectral and response transformations, predicting 
    covariates using OSSL data, and managing workflows via the 'tidymodels' framework. 
    Designed for internal use on high-performance systems, with support for parallel execution 
    and spectral clustering.
