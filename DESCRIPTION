Description: Tools for constructing, tuning, and evaluating stacked ensemble models
    for soil property prediction using mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy. Includes
    modular workflows for spectral preprocessing, response transformation, covariate
    integration, and model stacking using the 'tidymodels' ecosystem. Covariates can
    also be predicted directly from spectra using a locally-weighted Cubist modeling
    approach trained on global OSSL data. Designed for reproducible, high-throughput
    modeling pipelines with support for clustered calibration, caching, and parallel
    execution on high-performance systems.
