\title{Reduce Dimensionality of Spectral Data Using PCA}
\usage{
reduce_dimensions_pca_covpred(training_data, new_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{training_data}{A data frame containing training spectra, with numeric columns from \code{608} to \code{3992} representing wavenumbers.
Additional metadata columns are preserved.}

\item{new_data}{A data frame containing new spectra to project, with the same structure and wavenumber columns as \code{training_data}.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\item{training_data}{A tibble of PCA-transformed training data with original metadata.}
\item{new_data}{A tibble of PCA-transformed new data with original metadata.}
}
\description{
Applies PCA to training spectra and projects both training and new data into
a lower-dimensional space for covariate prediction. Retains up to 80 principal
components using \code{FactoMineR::PCA()}.
}
\details{
PCA is performed on the training set using \code{FactoMineR::PCA()} with scaling enabled and up to 80 components retained.
The trained PCA model is then used to project the \code{new_data} onto the same principal component space to ensure
consistent dimensionality reduction across datasets.
