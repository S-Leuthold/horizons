\usage{
create_project_configurations(
  project_data,
  models,
  transformations,
  preprocessing,
  soil_covariates = NULL,
  climate_covariates = NULL,
  spatial_covariates = NULL,
  expand_covariate_grid = TRUE,
  include_covariates = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{project_data}{A dataframe with Project and Sample_ID columns.}

\item{models}{Character vector of model names (e.g., "random_forest", "cubist").}

\item{transformations}{Character vector of outcome transformations.}

\item{preprocessing}{Character vector of preprocessing pipeline names.}

\item{soil_covariates}{Optional character vector (or "all") of soil covariates to predict.}

\item{climate_covariates}{Optional character vector (or "all") of climate covariates to fetch.}

\item{spatial_covariates}{Optional character vector of spatial covariates to fetch.}

\item{expand_covariate_grid}{Logical. If TRUE, generate all possible covariate subsets.}

\item{include_covariates}{Logical. Whether to include covariates in modeling grid.}
}
\value{
A tibble of model configurations, one per row, with a list-column of covariates.
}
\description{
Builds a model configuration grid by combining model types, response
transformations, preprocessing pipelines, and covariate combinations.
Covariates may be predicted or fetched from soil, climate, and spatial domains.
