\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A \code{recipes::recipe()} object.}

\item{...}{Selector functions to choose spectral columns (e.g., \code{all_predictors()}).}

\item{outcome}{Character. Name of the outcome variable to use for model fitting.}

\item{role}{Character. Role for retained variables. Default is \code{"predictor"}.}

\item{trained}{Logical. Required by \code{recipes}; indicates if the step has been prepped.}

\item{skip}{Logical. Should this step be skipped during \code{bake()}? Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{id}{Character. Unique identifier for the step. Auto-generated by default.}

\value{
A \code{step_select_boruta} object that can be added to a recipe.

\description{
Applies the Boruta algorithm to select informative spectral predictors by comparing
variable importance scores against randomized shadow features. Intended for use after
spectral preprocessing (e.g., SNV + derivatives) and before downstream modeling.
}
\details{
This step uses the Boruta feature selection algorithm, which runs a random forest model
comparing each original predictor to shuffled "shadow" variables. Variables consistently
more important than the best shadow are retained. The algorithm is run at \code{prep()} time.

For best results, this step should be applied \emph{after} spectral preprocessing (e.g. SNV,
derivatives) and \emph{before} PCA or model fitting. It may be computationally expensive
for large spectral datasets.
