\title{Project Unknowns to Library PCA Space}
\usage{
project_to_library_pca(new_data, pca_model, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{new_data}{Tibble with preprocessed spectral columns (same grid as library)}

\item{pca_model}{FactoMineR::PCA object from perform_pca_on_library()}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Print progress? Default: TRUE}
}
\value{
Matrix of PCA scores for unknown samples (n_samples × n_components)
Returns NULL if projection fails.
}
\description{
Projects new (unknown) spectra into the library PCA space using a trained
PCA model. Unknowns must have same preprocessing and wavenumber grid as
the library data used to train the PCA.
