\title{Calculate Mahalanobis Distance to Cluster Centroid}
\usage{
calculate_mahalanobis_distance(point, centroid, covariance)
}
\arguments{
\item{point}{Numeric vector. Point in PCA space}

\item{centroid}{Numeric vector. Cluster centroid}

\item{covariance}{Matrix. Cluster covariance matrix (regularized recommended)}
}
\value{
Numeric. Mahalanobis distance (positive value)
}
\description{
Computes Mahalanobis distance from a point to a cluster centroid using the
cluster's covariance matrix. This distance metric accounts for cluster shape
and correlation structure, making it ideal for applicability domain assessment.
}
\details{
Mahalanobis distance: D = sqrt((x - μ)' Σ⁻¹ (x - μ))
where x is the point, μ is centroid, Σ is covariance matrix

For identity covariance (uncorrelated, unit variance), this reduces to
Euclidean distance. For correlated variables, it accounts for covariance structure.
