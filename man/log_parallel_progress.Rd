\description{
Appends a log line to a per-worker file when given a directory, or to a single
file when given a file path (back-compat). Safe to call in parallel workers.

Append a single progress line to a log file (safe for concurrent appends).
If \code{log_file} is a directory, writes to \code{master.log} inside it.
