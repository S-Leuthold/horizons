\details{
This step uses the CARS feature selection algorithm, which iteratively performs
PLS regression with Monte Carlo sampling and exponentially decreasing retention
rates to identify the minimal optimal wavelength set. The algorithm is run at
\code{prep()} time.

For best results, this step should be applied \emph{after} spectral preprocessing (e.g. SNV,
derivatives) and \emph{before} PCA or model fitting. CARS is particularly effective for
identifying minimal wavelength sets that maintain predictive performance.
