\usage{
step_select_shap(
  recipe,
  ...,
  outcome,
  role = "predictor",
  trained = FALSE,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = recipes::rand_id("select_shap")

}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A \code{recipes::recipe()} object.}

\item{...}{Selector functions to choose spectral predictor columns.}

\item{outcome}{Character. Name of the outcome variable to use for modeling.}

\item{role}{Character. Role for selected predictors. Default is \code{"predictor"}.}

\item{trained}{Logical. Indicates if the step has been prepped. Required by \code{recipes}.}

\item{skip}{Logical. Should the step be skipped during \code{bake()}? Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{id}{Character. Unique step ID.}
}
\value{
A \code{step_select_shap} object.

\description{
Applies a SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) analysis to identify
important spectral bands using an XGBoost model. Retains predictors
with mean absolute SHAP values exceeding an adaptive threshold.
}
\details{
The step fits a shallow XGBoost model on the input spectral data (after optional
preprocessing) and computes SHAP values. Variables with SHAP importance â‰¥ mean + 1 SD
are retained. Requires \code{xgboost} and \code{SHAPforxgboost}.
