\title{Extract Coefficients from Stacks Model}
\usage{
extract_stacks_coefficients(stacks_model)
}
\arguments{
\item{stacks_model}{A fitted model_stack from \code{stacks::fit_members()}}
}
\value{
Named numeric vector of coefficients/weights for each ensemble member.
Names correspond to member identifiers, values sum to 1.0.
}
\description{
Extracts the blending coefficients (weights) from a fitted stacks model.
These coefficients are determined by the LASSO meta-learner and indicate
how much weight each base model receives in the final ensemble prediction.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# After fitting a stacks model
coefs <- extract_stacks_coefficients(ensemble_model)
# Returns: c(model_1 = 0.4, model_2 = 0.35, model_3 = 0.25)
}
