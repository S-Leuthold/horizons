\title{Filter Tuned Workflows Based on RRMSE and R² Thresholds}
\usage{
filter_workflows(wf_set_tuned, rrmse_quintile = 0.6, r2_quintile = 0.4)
}
\arguments{
\item{wf_set_tuned}{A tuned \code{workflow_set} object (from \code{workflow_map(tune_grid)})
containing resampling results for multiple model/recipe configurations.}

\item{rrmse_quintile}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the RRMSE quantile
to use as the upper threshold (e.g., 0.6 means keeping the top 60\% of performers).}

\item{r2_quintile}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the R² quantile
to use as the lower threshold (e.g., 0.4 means keeping the top 60\% of performers).}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{passed_workflows}{A \code{workflow_set} object containing only workflows that met both criteria.}
\item{rejected_workflows}{A tibble of workflows that were filtered out.}
\item{metrics_summary}{A tibble summarizing average RRMSE and R² for each workflow.}
\item{threshold_summary}{A tibble containing the computed RRMSE and R² thresholds.}
}
}
\description{
Evaluates and filters tuned workflows based on quantile-derived thresholds for
Relative Root Mean Squared Error (RRMSE) and R-squared (R²). This function is typically
used after an initial \code{tune_grid()} search within a \code{workflow_set()}. It computes
the mean RRMSE and R² across resamples for each workflow, determines dynamic thresholds
based on user-specified quantiles, and filters out models that do not meet both criteria.
