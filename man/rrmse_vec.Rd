\title{Relative Root Mean Squared Error (RRMSE)}
\usage{
rrmse_vec(data, truth, estimate, na_rm = TRUE, ...)

rrmse(data, truth, estimate, na_rm = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with columns for observed and predicted values.}

\item{truth}{The column identifier for observed values (quoted or unquoted).}

\item{estimate}{The column identifier for predicted values (quoted or unquoted).}

\item{na_rm}{Logical; should missing values be removed before computation? Default is TRUE.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{rmse_vec()}.}
}
\value{
\code{rrmse_vec()} returns a numeric value indicating the relative RMSE as a percentage.
\code{rrmse} returns a \code{yardstick} metric function that can be used in metric sets.
}
\description{
A custom regression metric for evaluating model accuracy relative to the scale
of the true values. RRMSE is computed as RMSE divided by the mean of the observed
values and expressed as a percentage. It is unitless, bounded below by 0, and useful
for comparing model performance across differently scaled variables.
}
\details{
This function is useful for evaluating model performance on variables that span different
units or orders of magnitude. It provides an interpretable, unitless error measure that
facilitates fair model comparison across multiple targets.

\examples{
rrmse_vec(
  data = data.frame(truth = c(1, 2, 3), estimate = c(1.1, 1.9, 3.2)),
  truth = truth,
  estimate = estimate
)

library(yardstick)
data <- tibble::tibble(obs = c(100, 120, 140), pred = c(105, 118, 135))
rrmse_vec(data, truth = obs, estimate = pred)

# Use as part of a yardstick metric set
metric_set(rrmse, rsq)(data, truth = obs, estimate = pred)
