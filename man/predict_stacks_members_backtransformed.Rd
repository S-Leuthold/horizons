\title{Predict from Stacks Members with Individual Back-Transformation}
\usage{
predict_stacks_members_backtransformed(
  member_workflows,
  transformations,
  new_data
)
}
\arguments{
\item{member_workflows}{List of fitted workflows from \code{extract_stacks_members()}}

\item{transformations}{Character vector of transformation types for each member.
Must be same length as \code{member_workflows}. Valid values: "log", "sqrt", "none".}

\item{new_data}{Data frame containing predictor variables for prediction}
}
\value{
Data frame with one column per member, all predictions on original scale.
Column names match member workflow names.
}
\description{
Generates predictions from each stacks ensemble member, applying individual
back-transformation based on each model's transformation type. This ensures
all predictions are on the original scale before being combined by the
meta-learner, correctly handling mixed transformations (e.g., some log,
some none).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# With mixed transformations
base_preds <- predict_stacks_members_backtransformed(
  member_workflows = list(log_model = wf1, none_model = wf2),
  transformations = c("log", "none"),
  new_data = test_data
)
# Returns: tibble with columns log_model and none_model (both original scale)
}
