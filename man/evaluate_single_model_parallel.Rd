\arguments{
\item{input_data}{A tibble containing spectral features with columns: Sample_ID, Wavenumber,
Absorbance, and the target response variable}

\item{covariate_data}{Optional tibble containing external covariates, matched by Sample_ID}

\item{variable}{Character. Name of the response variable to model}

\item{model}{Character. Model type (e.g., "random_forest", "cubist", "plsr")}

\item{transformation}{Character. Outcome transformation (e.g., "No Transformation", "Square Root Transformation")}

\item{preprocessing}{Character. Spectral preprocessing method (e.g., "raw", "snv", "deriv1")}

\item{feature_selection}{Character. Feature selection method (e.g., "none", "pca", "correlation")}

\item{covariates}{Character vector of covariate names to include}

\item{include_covariates}{Logical. Whether to include covariates in the model}

\item{grid_size}{Integer. Number of initial grid search candidates (default = 10)}

\item{bayesian_iter}{Integer. Number of Bayesian tuning iterations (default = 15)}

\item{cv_folds}{Integer. Number of cross-validation folds (default = 5)}

\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed for reproducible train/test splits and CV folds (default = NULL)}

\item{parallel}{Logical. Enable parallel processing for model tuning. Defaults to \code{FALSE} (safe for nested contexts).}

\item{n_workers}{Integer. Number of parallel workers for tuning. If \code{NULL}, uses \code{min(10, detectCores()-1)} for safety.}

\item{allow_nested}{Logical. Allow parallel processing even when already in parallel context. Defaults to \code{FALSE} (recommended).}

\item{pruning}{Logical. Whether to skip poor-performing models after grid tuning (default = TRUE)}
}
\value{
A list containing minimal information for memory efficiency:
\itemize{
\item \strong{model_id}: Unique identifier for this configuration
\item \strong{metrics}: Tibble with rmse, rrmse, rsq, rpd
\item \strong{best_params}: Best hyperparameters from tuning
\item \strong{runtime_seconds}: Total execution time
\item \strong{status}: "success", "failed", or "pruned"
\item \strong{error_info}: Detailed error information if failed
\item \strong{tuning_info}: Convergence and iteration details
}
}
\description{
Evaluates a single spectral model configuration with full tuning (grid search + Bayesian optimization)
but returns minimal information for memory efficiency in parallel processing. Designed for use
within parallel evaluation pipelines where many models run simultaneously.
